# Get Baked

## Purpose
An application for people who bake to share their recipes. Users are able to make posts and save other posts for a later time. Users are also able to post reviews on other recipes, allowing them to give positive or negative feedback on the recipe. Users will be able to view recipes and reviews without logging on, but to be able to make a post or leave a review, the user must sign up or log in.
